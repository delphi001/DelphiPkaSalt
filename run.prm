# By default HETATM is deleted. If user need HETATM for ligand/ion binding
# Set 1st "F", 3rd "T". And make HETATM in correct PQR format.
Remove HETATM                      : T
Remove water molecule              : T
HETATM in PQR format               : F

# For protonation only, set 2nd and 3rd options "F". Otherwise, all "T"

# 2nd and 3rd options can create PQR format at user-given pH value
Output PQR file (With Topology)    : T

# Parameters for Gaussian function in DelPhi
# 2nd represents variance (sigma) in Gaussian function
# 3rd represents reference dielectric constant
# 4th represents solvent   dielectric constant
# 5th represents number of grids/Angstrom for initial delphi run.
#     for large systems memory requirement may be very high with scale
#     1.0, so one can consider decreasing scale till 0.3 or so.
#     when scale is smaller than 1.0 increase focusing to scale ratio to 3
# 6th represents the scale ratio for focusing run to initial run
#     if initial scale is say 1.0 and focusing to initial scale 
#     ratio is 2, then two focusing rus will have scales of 1.0 * 2
#     = 2.0 and 2.0 * 2 i.e. 4.0 respectively.
